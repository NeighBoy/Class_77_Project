                Visual Studio is the Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
                provided by Microsoft in which developers can write and execute
                their program to develop various types of applications such as
                Windows, Web-based, console-based, Windows forms, and mobile

                A console traditionally refers to a computer terminal where a
                user may input commands and view output such as the results of 
                inputted commands or status messages from the computer. The console 
                is often connected to a remote computer or computer system that is 
                controlled from the console.
